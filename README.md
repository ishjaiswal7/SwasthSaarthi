# SwasthSaarthi
SwasthSaarthi (स्वस्थ सारथी), meaning "Health Companion" in Hindi, is an online platform designed to promote healthcare awareness and accessibility in rural areas. This project was developed in a 24-hour codeathon by a team of five using Java Servlet MVC architecture, JSP, and an Oracle database.

## Overview
SwasthSaarthi is built to connect rural residents with local healthcare resources. The application allows rural users to create an account, book appointments with registered doctors in their locality, and stay updated with local health-related events like vaccination camps, medical camps, and awareness marathons. Additionally, users can read blogs on health topics posted by healthcare workers.

The system supports three user roles:

### Rural Residents: 
Create accounts, login, book appointments with nearby doctors, and view local health events and blogs.
### Health Workers: 
Manage their appointments, create informative blog posts, and organize or promote health events in their area.
### Administrator: 
Monitors the platform's overall activity and manages health worker accounts.

This application serves as a bridge between healthcare providers and rural communities, helping to promote health literacy and improve access to medical support in remote regions.
